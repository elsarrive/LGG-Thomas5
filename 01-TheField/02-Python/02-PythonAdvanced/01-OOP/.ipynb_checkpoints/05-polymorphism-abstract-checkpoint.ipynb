    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.\n",
    "It enables the use of a single interface for different data types or classes. There are several types of polymorphism in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function Polymorphism: Python's built-in functions like len() can work with different data types\n",
    "- Class Polymorphism: Different classes can have methods with the same name\n",
    "- Inheritance-based Polymorphism: Child classes can override methods from parent classes\n",

    "#### Abstract methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract methods in Python are methods declared in an abstract class but lack implementation. They serve as a blueprint for subclasses, requiring them to provide specific implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract methods are defined using the @abstractmethod decorator from the abc module. They are typically part of an abstract base class (ABC)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Usage and Utility\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enforcing Interface: Abstract methods ensure that subclasses implement required methods, creating a consistent interface\n",
    "- Code Reusability: They promote code reuse by defining a common structure for related classes\n",
    "- Polymorphism: Abstract methods enable polymorphic behavior, allowing different subclasses to provide their own implementations\n",
    "- Encapsulation: They help encapsulate implementation details while exposing a clear interface\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When to Use Abstract Methods\n",
    "Use abstract methods in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- API Design: When designing APIs that require specific interfaces to be implemented\n",
    "- Plugin Architecture: For creating extensible systems where plugins need to adhere to a defined interface\n",
    "- Domain Modeling: When modeling complex domains and ensuring certain methods are implemented across all classes in the domain\n",
    "- Framework Development: To provide a structure for developers to extend and customize functionality\n",
    "- Standardization: When you want to enforce a standard set of methods across multiple related classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract methods are powerful tools for creating flexible, maintainable, and extensible code in Python. They help define clear contracts between base classes and their subclasses, ensuring consistent behavior across class hierarchies"
